# Migrating to NSPanel Easy

Welcome! 👋
If you're coming from [Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint),
you'll feel right at home here.
**NSPanel Easy** is derived from that project and keeps the same familiar structure,
so migrating is quick and straightforward - just a few small changes and you're done.

> [!TIP]
> The whole process typically takes less than 10 minutes per panel.
> No need to open your panel, no re-flashing via serial, and your automations keep working.

> [!NOTE]
> **New to NSPanel customization?**
> This guide is specifically for users migrating from Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint.
> If you're setting up a panel for the first time, head over to the
> [Getting Started Guide](install.md) instead - it will walk you through
> everything from scratch.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

- Your NSPanel already running with **Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint**
- Access to your **Home Assistant** instance
- Access to the **ESPHome Dashboard** (Add-on or standalone)

> [!NOTE]
> Your panel's Wi-Fi settings, device name, and substitutions stay the same.
> You're only changing where ESPHome pulls its packages from.

---

## Step 1 - Update Your ESPHome Configuration

This is the main change. Open your panel's YAML file in the ESPHome Dashboard and update the
`packages` section to point to the new repository.

### What to change

#### OTA settings

On the new version we broke the connection between OTA and WiFi passwords, so you can easily change any of those. However, this change requires some new manual configuration when migrating.

Find your `substitutions` block and add the substitution `ota_password: ${wifi_password}`,
as that is how OTA password was defined on Blackymas project, but not here.

It will look something like this:

```yaml
substitutions:
  # Settings - Editable values
  device_name: "YOUR_NSPANEL_NAME"
  friendly_name: "Your panel's friendly name"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ${wifi_password}  # IMPORTANT! For backward compatibility
  language: en                    # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes
```

> [!NOTE] Setting OTA to use WiFi is only necessary if you are migrating wirelessly.
> When migrating via USB/TTL you can freely select your OTA password or leave without one.

#### Language

Language is no longer selected in the Blueprint. You must now set it as a substitution
in your ESPHome YAML. Find your `substitutions` block and add:

```yaml
substitutions:
  language: en  # Replace with your language code
```

For the full list of supported language codes, see [Localization](localization.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you skip this step your panel will fall back to English after migration,
> regardless of what language you had selected in the old Blueprint.

#### Remote package reference

Find your `remote_package` block. It currently looks something like this:

```yaml
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint
    ref: main  # or whatever version you were using
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml # Base package
      # Add-ons you may have enabled:
      # - nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml
      # - nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_cool.yaml
      # - nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_dual.yaml
      # - nspanel_esphome_addon_cover.yaml
```

Change it to:

```yaml
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml # Base package
      # Add-ons you may have enabled:
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_cool.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_dual.yaml
      # - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_cover.yaml
```

### Summary of changes

| Setting | Before (Blackymas) | After (NSPanel Easy) |
| :------ | :------------------ | :------------------- |
| `ota_password` | It was set on the remote package to use your WiFi password | You have to add the substitution `ota_password: ${wifi_password}` for backward compatibility |
| `language` | Selected via Blueprint dropdown | Set as `language: xx` substitution in ESPHome YAML - see [Localization](localization.md) |
| `url` | `https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint` | `https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy` |
| `ref` | `main` (or a specific version) | `latest` |
| Add-on file paths | Root level (e.g. `nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml`) | Inside `esphome/` folder (e.g. `esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml`) |
| Base package | `nspanel_esphome.yaml` | `nspanel_esphome.yaml` *(no change)* |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **base package** (`nspanel_esphome.yaml`) stays at the root level - no path change needed.
> Only the **add-on files** moved into the `esphome/` subfolder.

### Example: Complete configuration after migration

Here's a typical panel configuration after migrating, using the climate dual add-on as an example:

```yaml
substitutions:
  device_name: "my-nspanel"
  friendly_name: "My NSPanel"
  wifi_ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  wifi_password: !secret wifi_password
  ota_password: ${wifi_password}  # IMPORTANT! For backward compatibility
  language: en                    # Language code - see docs/localization.md for all supported codes

  # Add-on configuration (if needed)
  ## Upload TFT
  upload_tft_automatically: true
  ## Climate add-on
  heater_relay: "1"  # Possible values: "1" or "2"
  cooler_relay: "2"  # Possible values: "1" or "2"

# Customization area
##### My customization - Start #####
##### My customization - End #####

# Packages
packages:
  remote_package:
    url: https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy
    ref: latest
    refresh: 300s
    files:
      - nspanel_esphome.yaml # Base package
      - esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_dual.yaml
```

## CJK language support

CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) language support is now built into the standard TFT files.
There are no separate CJK variants, simply select the model matching your hardware
(**NSPanel EU**, **NSPanel US**, or **NSPanel US Landscape**) regardless of the language you use.

---

## Step 2 - Flash the Updated Firmware

Once you've saved the YAML changes:

1. In the **ESPHome Dashboard**, find your panel and click the three-dot menu.
2. Select **Install** → **Wirelessly**.
3. Wait for the compilation and upload to complete.

Your panel will reboot with the new firmware. This is a standard OTA update -
no need to open the panel or use a serial adapter.

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple panels, repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each one.

---

## Step 3 - Update the Blueprint

Now let's switch your automations to use the new Blueprint.
The good news is you **don't need to reconfigure anything**,
we'll just import the new Blueprint and point your existing automations to it.

### 3a. Import the new Blueprint

First, import the NSPanel Easy Blueprint into Home Assistant.
Click the button below to do it directly:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fedwardtfn%2FNSPanel-Easy%2Frefs%2Ftags%2Flatest%2Fnspanel_easy_blueprint.yaml)
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Alternatively, you can import it manually:

1. Go to
   [**Settings** → **Automations & Scenes** → **Blueprints**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprints/).
2. Click the **Import Blueprint** button (bottom-right corner).
3. Paste this URL:

   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy/refs/tags/latest/nspanel_easy_blueprint.yaml
   ```

4. Click **Preview Blueprint** and then **Import Blueprint**.

At this point you'll have **both** the old and new Blueprints listed - that's perfectly fine.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of blueprint import dialog -->

### 3b. Switch your automations to the new Blueprint

This is where the magic happens - we'll edit the automation's YAML directly so all your
existing settings (entities, buttons, language, weather, etc.) are preserved as-is.

1. Go to [**Settings** → **Automations & Scenes**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/automations/).
2. Find your NSPanel automation in the list and click on it to open it.
3. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) in the top-right corner and select **Edit in YAML**.

   <!-- TODO: Add screenshot of "Edit in YAML" menu option -->

4. At the top of the YAML, find the `use_blueprint` section. It will look something like this:

   ```yaml
   use_blueprint:
     path: Blackymas/nspanel_blueprint.yaml
     input:
       # ... all your settings here ...
   ```

5. Change **only** the `path` line to point to the new Blueprint:

   ```yaml
   use_blueprint:
     path: edwardtfn/nspanel_easy_blueprint.yaml
     input:
       # ... all your settings remain exactly the same ...
   ```

6. Click **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** change anything in the `input:` section - that's where all your panel settings live.
> By only changing the `path`, your entire configuration carries over to the new Blueprint.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple panels, repeat this process for each panel's automation.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

### 3c. Verify your automations

After saving, switch back to the visual editor to confirm everything looks right:

1. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) again and select **Edit in visual editor**.
2. Review that your settings (device, entities, weather, language, etc.) are still in place.
3. The automation should now show the new Blueprint name.

### 3d. Remove the old Blueprint

Once all your automations are working with the new Blueprint, you can clean up:

1. Go to
   [**Settings** → **Automations & Scenes** → **Blueprints**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprints/).
2. Find the **old** Blueprint from Blackymas.
3. Check the **In use** column - it should show **0**, meaning no automations are still using it.
   If it shows a number other than 0, go back to Step 3b and migrate those automations first.
4. Click the three-dot menu next to it and select **Delete blueprint**.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of blueprint deletion -->

---

## Step 4 - Update the TFT Display

The display file (TFT) needs to be updated to match the new firmware:

1. In Home Assistant, go to your panel's **device page**
   (under **Settings** → **Devices & services** → **ESPHome** → *your panel*).
2. Select the correct **Display Model** for your panel (EU, US, or US Landscape).
3. Press the **Update TFT display** button.
4. Wait for the transfer to complete (usually 10–20 minutes).

> [!TIP]
> If the transfer doesn't start right away, don't worry - ESPHome will retry automatically
> with different parameters. Give it up to a minute to begin.

## Troubleshooting

### The firmware won't compile after changing the URL

Double-check that:

- The `url` is exactly `https://github.com/edwardtfn/NSPanel-Easy`
- The `ref` is `latest` (not a version tag from the old repository).
  After this first migration install, you'll be able to use version tags
  in the same format (e.g. `ref: v5.0.0`) once NSPanel Easy publishes releases.
- Add-on files use the `esphome/` prefix (e.g. `esphome/nspanel_esphome_addon_climate_heat.yaml`)
- The base package `nspanel_esphome.yaml` does **not** have the `esphome/` prefix

### My automation shows an error after changing the Blueprint path

Make sure the `path` value matches exactly what Home Assistant assigned to the imported Blueprint.
You can verify the correct path by creating a **temporary test automation** from the new Blueprint:

1. Go to **Blueprints**, click the new NSPanel Easy Blueprint, and create a dummy automation.
2. Switch to **Edit in YAML** and note the `path` value.
3. Use that exact path in your real automation(s).
4. Delete the test automation.

### The TFT transfer fails

Consult the [TFT Transfer Troubleshooting Guide](tft_upload.md) for detailed help.
The most common fix is to ensure your panel has enough free memory for the transfer.

### My panel is offline after the update

Try restarting the panel by cutting and restoring power.
If it still doesn't come online, check the ESPHome logs for compilation or connectivity errors.

## FAQ

**Q: Will I lose my settings?**
A: No. Your `substitutions`, Wi-Fi credentials, and automation settings are preserved.

**Q: Do I need to re-flash via serial (USB-to-TTL)?**
A: No. The migration is done entirely over Wi-Fi (OTA update).

**Q: Can I go back to Blackymas if needed?**
A: Yes. Simply reverse the URL and ref changes in your YAML, re-flash,
and switch your automation's Blueprint path back to the old one.

**Q: Do I need to update all my panels at once?**
A: No. You can migrate one panel at a time. Each panel is independent.

**Q: My panel is now showing English instead of my language after migration.**
A: Language is no longer configured in the Blueprint. Add `language: xx` to your
ESPHome `substitutions` block and reflash. See [Localization](localization.md) for supported codes.
