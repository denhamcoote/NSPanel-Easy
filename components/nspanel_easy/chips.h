/**

 * @brief Chip state shadow for the NSPanel status chip bar.
 *
 * Defines the ChipState struct and the chip_states array that ESPHome uses
 * to remember each chip's last-known icon, color, and visibility so that
 * home and screensaver pages can be re-rendered at any time without waiting
 * for the blueprint to resend data.
 *
 * Chip index mapping (matches CHIP_NAMES order):
 *   0 — chip_relay1
 *   1 — chip_relay2
 *   2 — chip_climate
 *   3 — chip01
 *   4 — chip02
 *   5 — chip03
 *   6 — chip04
 *   7 — chip05
 *   8 — chip06
 *   9 — chip07
 *
 * Component names are unscoped (no page prefix) so that a single write lands
 * on whichever page (home or screensaver) is currently visible.
